Creamsicle is a Rainmeter skin that displays realtime hardware values!

Why use it?
Utilizing Rainmeter the values can be displayed
in a nice fashion as well as very discrete values
such as specific core voltages may be read using
HWiNFO!

Dependicies:
Rainmeter: https://www.rainmeter.net/
HWiNFO64: https://www.hwinfo.com/download.php

Hopefully not many, but depending on your hardware setup
variables may need to be changed to work properly.
To do so modify the values in the HWiNFO.inc with the values 
in the HWiNFOSharedMemoryViewer. This may take some digging arround.

Example:
I want to read the fan speed of my mobo's cpu fan header.
In HWiNFOSharedMemoryViewer I find my mobo, and find CPU:
Here we see the mobo's ID and Instance, as well as the
CPU fan's ID, Type, Units, Current, Minimum, Maximum, Average
Modify the values in HWiNFO.inc appropriately:
These values may be different for you!
MOBO-SID=0xf7067930
MOBO-SIN=0x0
MOBO-FAN-CPU=0x3000001

Then in Rainmeter I make a lookup and save as meter
[MOBO_FAN_CH2]
Measure=Plugin
Plugin=HWiNFO.dll
HWiNFOSensorID=#MOBO-SID#
HWiNFOSensorInstance=#MOBO-SIN#
HWiNFOEntryId=#MOBO-FAN-CH2#
HWiNFOType=CurrentValue

Then have another meter display it:
[Meter_MOBO_FAN_CH2]
Meter=String
X=0
Y=0
MeasureName=MOBO_FAN_CH2
Text="%1RPM"
