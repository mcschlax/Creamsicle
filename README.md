A Rainmeter skin that displays realtime hardware values!

Why use it?
Utilizing Rainmeter the values can be displayed
in a nice fashion as well as very discrete values
such as specific core voltages may be read using
HWiNFO!

Dependicies:
Rainmeter: https://www.rainmeter.net/
HWiNFO64: https://www.hwinfo.com/download.php

Hopefully not many, but depending on your hardware setup
variables may need to be changed to work properly.
To do so modify the values in the HWiNFO.inc with the values 
in the HWiNFOSharedMemoryViewer. This may take some digging arround.
